// So, welcome to the notes where i'll be dumping all of the code, or the explanaition of the code i will need to understand in order to code a game. Efficiently? Maybe. This is gonna be a little long, so hang tight and let's begin! //

//All i'm doing for now is based on the book Foundational Game Design with HTML5 and Javascript

//First thing first, i am noticing that no <head> element is being created, just a <title> after the <!doctype html> element, which to be honest feels kinda weird, we are only making a button that receives an input an after that decides whether or not the answer is correct, so this is not really what we are looking for.//
